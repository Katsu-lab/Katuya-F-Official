                            <p>Analogical thinking is one of the important skills to make creative activities meaningful. On the other hand, there are few learning opportunities that consciously require the exercise of such analogical thinking, and analogical thinking. There is not enough learning material to cultivate thinking ability. One of the reasons is that the thinking process in analogical activities is not clear, and it is difficult to realize highly accurate support that contributes to this improvement. Even in the analogical process, we will consider support that focuses on abstraction and materialization activities that are considered to be common. In this research, we focus on how to use words as learning materials. The analogy gives the conceptual structure of general psychology and lessons a linguistic expression that is easy to remember and recall. The reason for using the analogy as a learning material is to abstract the structure of the things that we are currently facing. This is because we thought that we could find homogeneity between the analogical act of embodying another case of structurally the same type, and the generalization that captures the conceptual structure of a specific event and the application of the slogan. Therefore, in this study, the learner's abstraction and concreteness are achieved through a series of cognitive activities in which the analogy is conceptually understood (abstraction) and applied to the case (concrete), or conversely, the case is generalized and applied to the case. The purpose is to develop a system that fosters conversion skills.

                            <p>Just as the conveyor belt sushi system that was inspired by the conveyor belt operating in a beer factory was created, the analogical thinking ability to utilize the knowledge gained in one context in another context makes creative activities meaningful. It is an important skill for making sushi. On the other hand, there are not many learning opportunities that require the exercise of such analogical thinking as an explicit task, and the preparation of learning materials to cultivate analogical thinking ability is sufficient. Unprepared.
                             Therefore, in this study, we developed an analogical thinking training system through mystery as an issue that requires the exercise of analogical thinking.
